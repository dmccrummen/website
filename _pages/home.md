Well, a good dog on the ground's worth three in the saddle
No matter where you're from
Been many good dog was a friend to a man
But Sam was the greatest one

He was the hound of hounds
He was the wonder of all walkers
He loved howling at the moon
He loved treeing that raccoon

Most of all he was my best friend
And he's gone too soon

He was the runt of the litter
But a plenty mean pup
Put Sam on the scent and he'd never let up
Spent his nights on the porch chewing on a bear bone
Now he's underground and I'm all alone

Well, a good dog on the ground's worth three in the saddle
No matter where you're from
Been many good dog was a friend to a man
But Sam was the greatest one

He was the hound of hounds
He was the wonder of all walkers
He loved howling at the moon
He loved treeing that raccoon

Most of all he was my best friend
And he's gone too soon
